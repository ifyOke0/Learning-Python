### ✅ Class
"""
A class in python is a blueprint for creating objects.
It groups related data (attributes) and actions (methods) together.
Think of a class like a template;
where it defines characteristics like color, size, etc...
"""
class Book:
    pass


### ✅ Object:
"""
An object is an instance of a class in Python. It represents a specific 
example of the blueprint defined by class. Now with our Dog; 
If Dog is a class, then `variable` my_dog could be an object representing a specific dog with
it's details or functions, like name or age.
"""

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Object of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Schrodinger", 5)


### ✅ Inheritance
"""
Inheritance allows you to create a new class that uses the features of 
an already existing class without necessarily changing it.

This lets you build on existing functionality while keeping the original 
class intact.
"""

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def spreche(self):
        print(f"{self.name} sagst: Sei zufrienden")

#Derived class
class Dog(Animal):
    def spreche(self):
        print(f"{self.name} bellst")


# Creating an object for the dog class
my_dog =Dog("Arf")
my_dog.spreche()  # Output: Arf bellst
'''
Dog is a derived class which inherits from Animal class.
---
Overrides spreche(speak) method to provide a behaviour for parsed in (Animal).
'''


### ✅ Encapsulation
"""
In Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), we can restrict access 
to methods and variables to prevent direct modification, 
especially when dealing with multiple lines of codes all performing various functions.
This is referred to as encapsulation.
"""

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.__age = age    #Private attribute

    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age   #Accessor method

person = Person("Alice", 30)
print(person.get_age())     #Gives an output of 30

'''
It's noted from this example that the 'the__age attribute is private,
and can only be accessed by calling the get_age() method.
'''


### ✅ Polymorphism:
"""
Polymorphism really means "more than one forms." In programming (python🤧),
polymorphism allows a single entity (like a method, operator, or object)
to take on different forms and behave differently in various scenarios, as needed. 
"""

class Pferd:
    def speak(self):
        print("Neigh")

class Eule:
    def speak(self):
        print("Hoot")

def animal_speak(animal):
    animal.speak()

# Using polymorphism
pferd = Pferd()
eule = Eule()

animal_speak(pferd)  # Neigh
animal_speak(eule)   # Hoot



        ### Try Area

## Basic Functions
'''
functions are simple, and doesn't include any aparameters or return values
and performs a single task, like so...;
'''
def greet():
    print("Hallo, Leute!")


## Functions with parameters
#: functions accepting parameters are more flexible and readable.
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hallo, {name}")


## Functions with Return Values
'''
functions return values, used instead of printing,
allowing caller to use the result, return ends the code and starts outside the function(def).
'''
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
result = add(3, 5)
print(result)


## Functions with Default Parameters
#: Introducing default parameters makes the function to be more versatile.
def greet(name="Welt"):
    print(f"Hallo, {name}!")
greet()
greet("Henify_") # Replaces name="..." value to Henify_


## Functions with Variable Arguments
'''
Using " *args and **kwargs" in python lets 
functions to handle variable number arguments.
'''

def add_all(*args):       # With *args
    return sum(args)
print(add_all(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

def print_info(**kwargs):  # With **kwargs
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_info(name="Henry", age=17)


## Intermediate Functions (Higher_Order_Functions, Lambdas, and Decorators)
'''
Higher level functions; these functions take other functions as arguments or return them.
Lambdas; Anonymous, inline functions.
Decorators: Modifies behaviour of other functions
'''

def apply_functions(func, value):
    return func(value)
print(apply_functions(lambda x: x**2, 5))

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper()

@decorator  #Decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hallo ✌🏾")
say_hello()
